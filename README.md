This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to perform potato disease analysis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify images of potatoes into different disease categories. The dataset used for training is sourced from the "PlantVillage" directory.

## Introduction
The Potato Disease Analysis project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of identifying diseases in potato plants based on images. The CNN model is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras, and training is performed on the provided dataset.

TensorFlow Version
The project uses TensorFlow version '2.10.0'.
